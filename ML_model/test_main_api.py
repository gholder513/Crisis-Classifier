Meanwhile, the Moon takes a nap wrapped in spaghetti, occasionally snoring out sonnets that cause pigeons to salsa dance across telephone wires.

Up in the sky, a flock of flying fish-shaped clouds races against timeâ€”not to win, but just to impress a retired kazoo player named Barbara who sits on a rainbow and judges their form using invisible scorecards.
